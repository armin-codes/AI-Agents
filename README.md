What you gonna get in this code:
* ai agents that have random job and choose random activities
* but the activites in work time depends on the job
* this code also has to long lists of first and last names for the agents(they're long so you don't get the same names over and over)

 i would LOVE to hear your advices and what are my mistakes in this code , and what should i add
 and once again , this program is not ready and is not precise
